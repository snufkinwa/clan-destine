## Overview

Welcome to the Fantasy Rhythm Game! (Still deciding on a name) This 3D experience combines rhythm-based gameplay with a fantasy setting, allowing players to immerse themselves in a procedurally generated world based on their music uploads. With hand-tracking integration and real-time music analysis, the game generates rhythm boxes on the fly.

**Current Status:** ðŸš§ _Under Construction_

## Features (In Progress)

- **Real-Time Music Integration:** Upload your own MP3 or M4A tracks, and the game generates rhythm boxes on the spot, with no predefined maps.
- **Hand-Tracking Integration:** Use hand movements to interact with rhythm boxes, synced to your uploaded music.
- **Optional Keyboard Controls:** If hand tracking isnâ€™t available, players can use the keyboard to play.
- **Procedurally Generated Gameplay:** Each track you upload creates a unique gameplay experience with no two sessions being the same.
- **Fantasy-Themed Environment:** Navigate in a mystical world as you engage with rhythm challenges.

## Technical Stack

- **Audio Processing:** The game leverages the MDN Web Docs' Audio API for real-time music analysis and generating rhythm boxes based on the beats and structure of the uploaded music files.
- **3D Environment:** Using MDN 3D game development documentation to craft an immersive fantasy themed 3D environment while ensuring smooth integration with music-driven gameplay.

## Controls (In Development)

- **Hand Tracking:** Use hand movements to hit rhythm boxes as they appear in sync with the music.
- **Optional Keyboard Controls:** WASD or arrow keys for movement and interaction if hand tracking is unavailable.
